# hill-cipher
Hill cipher in C++ that takes the message and the key from the console and encrypts it.

Build with GCC 11.3.0 (C++20)

Put your message in the date.in file and then the key.

The key must be formed out of 9 capital letters.

The message must be written in capital letters without any white spaces. 
In case the number of letters cannot be grouped by 3 we will compensate by adding extra A letters at the end of input.

At lines 76 and 79 you can increase the parameter size for larger strings.

The output will be displayed in the console.
